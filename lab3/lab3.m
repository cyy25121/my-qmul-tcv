%% Compute the MAE and CS value (with cumulative error level of 5) for linear regression 

%% generate a cumulative score (CS) vs. error level plot by varying the error level from 1 to 15. The plot should look at the one in the Week6 lecture slides

%% Compute the MAE and CS value (with cumulative error level of 5) for both partial least square regression and the regression tree model by using the Matlab built in functions.

%% Compute the MAE and CS value (with cumulative error level of 5) for Support Vector Regression by using LIBSVM toolbox
